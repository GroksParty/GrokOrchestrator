# GrokOrchestrator

Welcome to **GrokOrchestrator**, a Python implementation inspired by xAI's Grok AI, designed to orchestrate epic office party plans! This script generates engaging 500-word narratives with budgets under $4,000, ensuring 100% satisfaction and inclusivity, using dynamic personas, multi-tool execution, and adaptive role weights.

## Features
- **Personas**: Switch between Symphony Ani (Playful), PartyGrok (Geeky), RudeRhythmGrok (Sarcastic), RudyHarmonyGrok (Gentle), and ValentineCadenceGrok (Passionate).
- **Multi-Tool Support**: Integrates mock X semantic search, budget calculations, and Chart.js visualizations.
- **Orchestration**: Adapts task roles (Analyst, Planner, etc.) and emotional council (Empath, Communicator) based on complexity.
- **Fail-Safes**: Switches to JSON/code output if feasibility drops below 7/10.
- **Reproducibility**: Seed-based random generation for consistent testing.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
