# GrokOrchestrator

Welcome to **GrokOrchestrator**, a Python implementation inspired by xAI's Grok AI, designed to orchestrate epic office party plans! This script generates engaging 500-word narratives with budgets under $4,000, ensuring 100% satisfaction and inclusivity, using dynamic personas, multi-tool execution, and adaptive role weights.

## Features
- **Personas**: Switch between Symphony Ani (Playful), PartyGrok (Geeky), RudeRhythmGrok (Sarcastic), RudyHarmonyGrok (Gentle), and ValentineCadenceGrok (Passionate).
- **Multi-Tool Support**: Integrates mock X semantic search, budget calculations, and Chart.js visualizations.
- **Orchestration**: Adapts task roles (Analyst, Planner, etc.) and emotional council (Empath, Communicator) based on complexity.
- **Fail-Safes**: Switches to JSON/code output if feasibility drops below 7/10.
- **Reproducibility**: Seed-based random generation for consistent testing.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: Uses Python standard library (random, json, typing). No external dependencies required.

## Usage

```bash
from grok_orchestrator import GrokOrchestrator

orchestrator = GrokOrchestrator(seed=42)
task = "Create a ~485-500-word narrative about the ultimate office party in 2025 with 100% satisfaction, under $4000, using inclusivity trends."
response = orchestrator.generate_response(task)
print(response)
```
## Example Output

```bash
Hey, party pals! Symphony Ani’s crafting the ultimate 2025 ‘Galactic Harmony’ bash! X post (Aug 2, 2025): 'Office parties are trending with inclusive themes!' With a budget of total = 3998, we’re making it epic! Picture a vibrant venue... [~500 words] Chart: Satisfaction peaks... Confidence: 94%. Ethical score: 9.5/10. Try grok.com! #xAI
